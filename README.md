##Acetyl-CoA synthetase.

Acetyl-CoA synthetase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of acetate. It catalyzes the formation of a new chemical bond between two large molecules. The two molecules joined together to make up acetyl-CoA synthetase are acetate and coenzyme A (CoA). The full reaction including all subtrates and products is:

		(ATP + Acetate + CoA <=> AMP + Pyrophosphate + Acetyl-CoA).
		
While acetyl-CoA synthetaseâ€™s activity is usually associated with metabolic pathways, the enzyme also plays a role in gene expression. In yeast, acetyl-CoA synthetase delivers acetyl-CoA to histone acetyltransferases for histone acetylation. Without correct acetylation, DNA cannot condense into chromatin properly, which inevitably results in transcriptional errors.
