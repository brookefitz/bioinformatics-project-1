##Acetyl-CoA synthetase

Acetyl-CoA synthetase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of acetate. It catalyzes the formation of a new chemical bond between two large molecules. The two molecules joined together to make up acetyl-CoA synthetase are acetate and coenzyme A (CoA). The full reaction including all subtrates and products is:

	ATP + Acetate + CoA <=> AMP + Pyrophosphate + Acetyl-CoA
While acetyl-CoA synthetaseâ€™s activity is usually associated with metabolic pathways, the enzyme also plays a role in gene expression. In yeast, acetyl-CoA synthetase delivers acetyl-CoA to histone acetyltransferases for histone acetylation. Without correct acetylation, DNA cannot condense into chromatin properly, which inevitably results in transcriptional errors.

##Malate dehydrogenase (MDH)

Malate dehydrogenase is a group of multimeric enzymes made up of identical subunits. It serves as to reversibly catalyze the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of NAD^+ to NADH. The active site of malate dehydrogenase occurs in a hydrophobic cavity within the protein complex that has binding sites specifically for the substrate and its coenzyme. The enzyme's reaction is part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle.

##Antiporter inner membrane protein (MRP)

An antiporter is an integral membrane protein involved in the secondary active transport of two or more different molecules or ions. The molecules are simultaneously transported in opposite directions across a phospholipid membrane, meaning one molecule goes deeper into the cell through the inner membrane and one moves farther out of the cell towards the outer membrane.

##Glycogen phosphorylase

Glycogen phosphorylase is one of the phosphorylase enzymes that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis in animals by releasing glucose-1-phosphate from the termincal alpa-1,4-glycosidic bond. It is also studied as a model protein regulated by both reverisble phosphorylation and allosteric effects. As for as clinical significance, glycogen phosphorylase has been proposed as a biomarker for multiple diseases and health issues such McArdle's Disease (glycogen storage disease type V), Hers' Disease (glycogen storage disease type VI), and gastric cancer. Glycogen phosphorylase has also been proposed as one method for treating type 2 diabetes.

##Enolase

Enolase is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which are the ninth and penultimate steps of glycolysis. The chemical reaction that enolase catalyzes is:

	2-PG <=> PEP + H2O
The enolase belongs to a family of hydro-lyases, which break up carbon-oxygen bonds. It is present in all tissues and organism capable of glycolysis or fermentation. In some recent medical experiments, samples of enolase concentrations have been taken from patients in an attempt to diagnose certain conditions and their severity.
