##Acetyl-CoA synthetase

Acetyl-CoA synthetase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of acetate. It catalyzes the formation of a new chemical bond between two large molecules. The two molecules joined together to make up acetyl-CoA synthetase are acetate and coenzyme A (CoA). The full reaction including all subtrates and products is:

		(ATP + Acetate + CoA <=> AMP + Pyrophosphate + Acetyl-CoA)
While acetyl-CoA synthetaseâ€™s activity is usually associated with metabolic pathways, the enzyme also plays a role in gene expression. In yeast, acetyl-CoA synthetase delivers acetyl-CoA to histone acetyltransferases for histone acetylation. Without correct acetylation, DNA cannot condense into chromatin properly, which inevitably results in transcriptional errors.

##Malate dehydrogenase

Malate dehydrogenase is a group of multimeric enzymes made up of identical subunits. It serves as to reversibly catalyze the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of NAD^+ to NADH. The active site of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) occurs in a hydrophobic cavity within the protein complex that has binding sites specifically for the substrate and its coenzyme. The enzyme's reaction is part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle.
